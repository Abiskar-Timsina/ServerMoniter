A simple python based script that keeps the record of disk ususage over time and emails you the details periodically.This is a personal project for personal use. Passwords and emails entered during the one-time-config are stored in the classes/config folder (which will be created upon the first run). They are stored locally and are **NOT** encrypted. Emails and passwords are saved in classes/config/.config file. DO NOT share .config files

# Changes
This version is more readable and customizable. That being said; most constants are class variables and might require fidgeting around with the code to make personal changes.

###### Note
This is a very early version of the project. Error handling and other advanced features will be added in the later versions.
